# Tech task
## Objectives
- Create a todo-list application. Which includes next functionality:
    - Create a todo-item with a **title**, **description**, **priority** fields and a default status - **open**;
    - Edit all todo-item fields;
    - Move todo-item in **done** status;
    - Delete todo-item
    - Search todo-item by **title**;
    - Filter todo-item by **status**;
    - Filter todo-item by **priority**.
- For task implementation you must use:
    - pure `JavaScript (ES6, ES next)` with `Babel` transpiler (if needed) without frameworks;
    - any `CSS pre/post processor` (ex. `Sass` / `Scss` / `Post-CSS` / ...);
    - any module bundler (ex. `Webpack` / `Rollup` / ..);
    - any other technologies that youâ€™d like
- Your application should be based on Wireframes provided in the **Arch notes** section

- Filtered state:

## Acceptance criteria
- Only `JavaScript` should be used for task implementation;
- JavaScript code should be lintered with [`airbnb/javascript`](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) style guide;
- Any `CSS pre/post processor` should be used for task implementation;
- Any `module bundler` should be used for task implementation;
- Usage documentation should be provided in a `README` file;
- The solution should be placed on your own `GitHub` account;
- The solution should be placed on `GitHub pages`;
